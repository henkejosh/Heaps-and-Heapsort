# Heaps & Heapsort
Ruby implementation of a BinaryMinHeap and Heapsort.

## Heap Properties
### Parent/Child relationship
**Min Heap** - the value of a parent node must be less than or equal to the values of its children.

**Max Heap** - the value of a parent node must be greater than the values of its children.

### Height
When a heap is a full binary tree, a heap of n elements will always have **log(n) height**.
